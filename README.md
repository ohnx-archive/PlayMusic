Play Music in c#!

## about
The app automatically scans your music directory for music (in .mp3 form only) and starts playing.

The goal for this app is to be a simple music player. You run it, and forget about it (that is, unless you don't like the music being played.)

Within the UI, you can see the current song name and artist, see time elapsed/total time, skip the current song, pause/play the current song and enable/disable shuffle mode.

### mini vs large
in the UI, there is an arrow. This allows you to toggle between a "mini" and "larger" mode.
In mini mode, only the controls and song name are shown.
In the larger mode, a song list is shown and you can also select a song that you want to listen to.

### media keys
You can use the media keys to play/pause or skip the current song. (Only Play/pause and skip work, no skipping backwards or stopping or volume).

### naming convention
When getting the song name and artist name, it is assumed that all files are in a (pretty standard) format `artist name` - `song name`
